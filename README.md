# EFFICIENT LOW RESOLUTION IMAGE COMPRESSION - A LEARNABLE DOWNSCALING TECHNIQUE
# Abstract
Recently, remarkable performance has been observed to be achieved by learned image compression techniques, promising therefore to be adopted over large-scales as they significantly outperform the best classical lossy image coders. For the sake of practicality with regards to both compression performance and inference latency, a thorough investigation performed over the architectural design of learned image compression proves to be essential. In this paper, we propose a novel task-aware image compression architecture that integrates a latent feature-guided compression module identified as Attentive Deep Residual Block (ADRB), to identify the most crucial information to preserve during compression, while focusing on areas that need most improvement. To this ADRB we combine a conformed Upscaled block module for the adaptive extraction and enhancement of essential features necessary in image reconstruction. Furthermore, we explicitly preserve sharp transitions, edges while handling outliers and texture details through a balanced optimization of multiple objectives, leveraging the strengths of our newly introduced Edge-Perceptual Structural (EPS) loss. Ultimately, a great trade-off between rate-distortion performance and inference latency is attained by the proposed CNN-based Efficient Low Resolution Image Compression (ELRIC) model when trained with our optimized integrated techniques.
As per the extensive experiments, we argue that our proposed ELRIC method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of visual quality at low bitrates, while its generalization can enable handle an arbitrary image resizing operation.
